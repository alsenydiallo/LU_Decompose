Inluced Files:
--------------
- LUtest.c (containt a set of matrice test: 5x5, 10x10 and 600x600)
- LUdecomp.c : (contain algorithm for solving lineair system (matrice) matrice using LU decomposition)
- LUdecomp.h (conatain function declaration for the LUdecomp.c)
- Makefile (contain the compiling configuration)

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project is the first part of a two part project. The following progam impliment an algorithm for solving Lineair sytem in the form Ax=b using LU decomposition algorithm

Build and Run:
--------------
the build and run configuration in contained in the make file.

Note: make sure you save the Makefile as "Makefile" with no extentsion. Any extention ex: Makefile.txt will cause the make file not to run.

for runing the makefile just type "make" on the command line of a unix console
